# OFD Bounty Submission

## Overview
This submission demonstrates an integration of the OFD oracle-free stablecoin model on Hedera.

## Evidence
- ✅ Minted 100 OFD tokens using Hardhat local network
- ✅ Simulated collateral-based minting without oracles
- ✅ Proposed Hedera-based payment use case using OFD
- ✅ Included screenshots of terminal output and contract deployment

## Use Case
OFD is used as a stable payment token between users on Hedera. For example, User A sends 10 OFD to User B for freelance design work. This showcases trustless stablecoin utility without relying on centralized price feeds.
