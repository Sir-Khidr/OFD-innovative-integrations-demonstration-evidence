This submission demonstrates an integration of the OFD oracle-free stablecoin model on Hedera Testnet, including a simulated minting prototype and a conceptual front-end visualization.
# OFD Bounty Submission

## Overview
This submission demonstrates an integration of the OFD oracle-free stablecoin model on Hedera.

## Evidence
- ✅ Verified contract logic from the original OFD repository and adapted for Hedera compatibility  
- ✅ Minted 100 OFD tokens using Hardhat local network
- ✅ Simulated collateral-based minting without oracles
- ✅ Proposed Hedera-based payment use case using OFD
- ✅ Included screenshots of terminal output and contract deployment
- ✅ Deployed and interacted with OFD smart contracts using Hardhat local network  


## Use Case
This example highlights OFD’s potential for decentralized finance applications such as payments, lending, and microtransactions within the Hedera ecosystem.

OFD is used as a stable payment token between users on Hedera. For example, User A sends 10 OFD to User B for freelance design work. This showcases trustless stablecoin utility without relying on centralized price feeds.
